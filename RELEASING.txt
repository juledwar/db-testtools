To release a new version of db-testtools:

 1. Tag the current revision with the required release number, e.g.
    `git tag 2021.09.29`
 2. Build the package:
    `hatch build`
 3. Upload the package to testpyi first to make sure it is ok:
    `hatch run testpypi dist/*2021.9.29*`
 4. If that looks ok, upload to the real pypi:
    `hatch run pypi dist/*2021.9.29*`
 5. Push the new tag to Github:
    `git push origin 2021.09.29`
 6. Make a Github release
